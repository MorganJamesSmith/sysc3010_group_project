Our access control system will be designed to meet the needs of employers to
look after the safety of their employees. The scope of this project is to
provide employers with an access control system that grants access to employees
entering the workplace based on their measured body temperature. As studies
show that fever is the most frequent symptom in more than 50\% of COVID-19
cases our system also blocks access to employees with a body temperature
indicating a fever for 14 days to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the
workplace. Additionally, our system helps building owners adhere to social
distancing guidelines implemented by the government by keeping track of the
number of people on the premises and restricts employees from entering the
building when the maximum threshold for the workplace has been
attained. Although not in the scope of the project, our system would work with
employers to comply with their standards and constraints to provide their
employees access to a COVID-19 free workplace. Our system aims to enable a
COVID-19 free work environment.

Our access control system is a technology-based solution using a data collection
and management system whose primary features and their functionalities include:

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User should know if door is locked or unlocked
    \item User should know if they are too far away from temperature sensor
    \item User should be able to scan ID without touching the NFC reader
    \item Database should know how many users are in the building
    \item Server user should be able to render invalid ID of ill users
    \item Door lock should unlock when server requests unlock
    \item User should know if the building is at capacity
    \item Server should not request door unlock if user temperature is outside range
    \item Server should request door unlock if user temperature is within range
    \item Time of flight sensor should send to server distance of user from temperature sensor
    \item User should be able to exit if server finds maximum threshold of employees in building
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
