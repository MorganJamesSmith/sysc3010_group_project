Our access control system is designed to help employers look after the safety
of their employees. The scope of this project is to provide employers with an
access control system that grants access to the workplace based on their
measured body temperature. As studies show that fever is the most frequent
symptom in more than 50\% of COVID-19 cases, our system also blocks access to
users that had previously scored a body temperature indicating a fever in the
past 14 days. Additionally, our system helps building owners adhere to social
distancing guidelines implemented by the government by tracking the number of
people on the premises and restricting users from entering the building when
the maximum threshold for the building has been attained. Although not in the
scope of the project, our system would work with employers to comply with their
standards and constraints to provide their employees access to a COVID-19 free
workplace. Our system aims to enable a COVID-19 free work environment.

Our access control system is a technology-based solution using a data collection
and management system whose primary features and their functionalities include:

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

The below functional requirements are listed in order of priority.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Control access to a building using NFC security badges
    \item Require users to present their security badge when they enter or exit
          the building in order to track the number of users in the building
    \item Measure user's temperatures when they are entering the building in
          order to determine if they have possible symptoms
    \item Do not allow users with possible symptoms to enter the building
    \item Do not allow more users to enter the building if the a preset maximum
          capacity has been reached
    \item A central control server should make all access decisions and log
          information about accesses to the building in a database
    \item Building access requirements can be adjusted by the system operators
          using the operator GUI
    \item Access logs can be viewed by the system operators
          using the operator GUI
    \item A multicoloured LED at each door node should indicate be used to
          indicate the status of the door node
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The LED should be red when the door is locked
        \item LED should change to green when the door is unlocked
        \item LED should turn off when the building has reached capacity and
              further users are not being admitted
        \item LED should be orange/yellow when in the process of taking a temperature
              reading if the user is not within an appropriate range of the
              temperature sensor.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The door node should have a range sensor to determine whether users
          are in an appropriate position for a temperature reading
\end{itemize}
