Our access control system will be designed to meet the needs of employers to
look after the safety of their employees. The scope of this project is to
provide employers with an access control system that grants access to employees
entering the workplace based on their measured body temperature. As studies
show that fever is the most frequent symptom in more than 50\% of COVID-19
cases our system also blocks access to employees with a body temperature
indicating a fever for 14 days to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the
workplace. Additionally, our system helps building owners adhere to social
distancing guidelines implemented by the government by keeping track of the
number of people on the premises and restricts employees from entering the
building when the maximum threshold for the workplace has been
attained. Although not in the scope of the project, our system would work with
employers to comply with their standards and constraints to provide their
employees access to a COVID-19 free workplace. Our system aims to enable a
COVID-19 free work environment.

Our access control system is a technology-based solution using a data collection
and management system whose primary features and their functionalities include: 

\subsection{Door Node}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NFC security badge reader
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Available at each door node at both entry and exit ways
        \item Read valid NFC card ID and associate with employee ID
    \end{itemize}
    \item Infrared temperature sensor
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Available at each entry way
        \item Measure the body temperature of an employee trying to enter the
              work premises
        \item Alert control server in case of high temperature reading
    \end{itemize}
    \item Time of flight distance sensor
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Available at each entry way
        \item Identify if the employee is standing at an ideal distance from the
              temperature sensor.
    \end{itemize}
    \item LED display
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Available at each entry way
        \item Display a green light at the entrance if accepting employee entry
        \item Display a red circle light at the entrance when control server
              restricts access due to premises acquiring maximum threshold
        \item Display orange light if employee in range of the temperature
              sensor
        \item Display red light if employee not in range of temperature sensor
        \item Display flashing green light if control server authorizes employee
              to access after having temperature recorded
        \item Display flashing red light if control server unauthorizes employee
              from accessing the building after having temperature recorded 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Electronic door lock
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Available at each door node at both entry and exit ways
        \item Unlock only when control server authorizes the employee to
              enter/exit premises
        \item Locked when control server prevents access to employees with
              recorded fever temperatures
        \item Locked at entry ways when control server restricts access due to
              premises acquiring maximum threshold
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Control server}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Control server
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Able to access all door nodes
        \item Able to access database and available tables
        \item Identifies number of people entering and exiting the premises
        \item Initializes access restriction when maximum threshold of premises
              is acquired
    \end{itemize}
    \item Database
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Properly organized tables with appropriate entries for each
              individual field
        \item Properly formatted values for sensor recorded data fields
        \item Records of the temperature readings of all employees are
              accessible for at least 14 days 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Operator GUI
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Able to add new employee information
        \item Able to view details of all employees based on NFC security card
              user id and employee id
        \item Able to approve quarantine period initiated by the control server
              for individual employees
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
