Our project group has been working really hard in meeting the project timeline.
Although things didn’t go exactly as planned in the beginning of the term, our
group has successfully met most of the milestones set up so far. As some of the
submission dates have been postponed, our team continues to work towards
achieving set tasks and hopefully have all the required hardware and software
components ready and properly set up for the demo’s. So far, we haven’t had any
roadblocks regarding individual assigned tasks. We don’t think re-balancing
tasks is necessary as every team member has worked hard towards accomplishing
their assigned tasks and has contributed to group submission with good quality
work. We would consider ourselves to be well on track to accomplishing our goals
set up for the project.
