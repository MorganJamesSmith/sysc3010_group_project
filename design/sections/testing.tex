\subsection{Final Demo}

Table \ref{table:final-tests} lists the scenarios that we will test during the
final demo. These scenarios have been chosen to demonstrate the functional
requirements as listed in section \ref{sec:problem-statement}.

% Functional requirements:
% - Control access to a building using security badges.
% - Require users to present their security badge when they enter or exit the
%   building in order to track the number of users in the building.
% - Measure user's temperatures when they are entering the building in order to
%   determine if they have possible symptoms.
% - The door node should have a range sensor to determine whether users are in
%   an appropriate position for a temperature reading.
% - Do not allow more users to enter the building if the a preset maximum
%   capacity has been reached.
% - An multicoloured LED at each door node should indicate be used to indicate
%   the status of the door node. The LED should be normally red when the door is
%   locked and should change to green when the door is unlocked. The LED should
%   be orange when in the process of taking a temperature reading if the user is
%   not within an appropriate range of the temperature sensor.
