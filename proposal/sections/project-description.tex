\subsection{About Us}

As COVID-19 concerns bring everyday life all over the world to a standstill, our
team consisting of Carleton Engineering students, works towards tackling these
challenges and making life easier for consumers everywhere.

\subsection{The Team Project} 

As Governments proceed to re-open workplaces, how effective are the risk
management protocols implemented by employers? Are employers prepared for the
employees to come back? How can we be more aware and not panic in implementing
proper entry way guidelines to eliminate the risk of COVID-19? As people
around the world face these challenges everyday, our team works towards
providing the ultimate solution to following proper call-in procedures. We bring
to you a system that looks after the well being of your employees and follows
government regulated infection prevention policies, practices and guidelines for
workplaces. 

This Project will be designed to meet the needs of employers to look after the
safety of their employees. Our groundbreaking access control system complies
with employer standards and provides employees access to a COVID-19 free
workplace. As studies show that fever ($<$ 39.1 Â°C) is the most frequent symptom
in more than 50\% of COVID-19 cases \cite{Michelen_2020}, our system prevents
entry to employees that present symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, our system
adheres to social distancing guidelines implimented by the government and
restricts access to reduce the spread of COVID-19. With many more features and
benefits, implementing our system at workplaces around the world, successfully
helps in providing a COVID-19 free work environment for employees. 

\subsection{Project Features}

Our revolutionary access control system will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Display a green light at the entrance if it is accepting people
    \item Be equipped with a Near Field Communication (NFC) security badge
          reader
    \item Recognize employees based on their NFC security cards presented to
          the reader 
    \item Measure the body temperature of an employee trying to enter the work
          premises 
    \item Prevent access to employees with a fever
    \item Keep track of employee details such as their body temperature
          measurement for last 14 days
    \item Track and limit the maximum number of people in an area and display a
          red light at the entrance when the area has reached capacity
    \item Send SMS and email notifications on system failure
    \item Send SMS and email notifications when building is near capacity
    \item Send SMS and email notifications to users when their
          quarantine period is complete
\end{itemize}
