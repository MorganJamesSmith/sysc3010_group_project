\subsection{Milestones}

\paragraph{Complete Initial Research}
By this point we should have completed all of out research in order to select
what hardware and libraries we would like to use for our project.

\paragraph{Complete Hardware Interface Code}
By this point all of the code responsible for interfacing with hardware and all
of the associated test stubs and applications should be complete. Work on this
milestone can be done in parallel with work on the communication and application
code.

\paragraph{Complete Communication Code}
By this point all of the code for exchanging information between door
nodes and the control server as well as all of the associated test stubs and
applications should be complete. Work on this milestone can be done in parallel
with work on the hardware interface and application code.

\paragraph{Complete Door Model}
By this point a 3D printed model door will be attached to a servo
attached to a Raspberry Pi with appropriate drivers.

\paragraph{Complete Application Code}
By this point all of the application level code should be complete and we should
be performing integration testing. Work on this milestone can be done in
parallel with work on the hardware interface and communication code.

\paragraph{Complete User Interface}
By this point the graphical user interface should be complete. We should be
performing integration testing of our complete system. Work on this milestone
can be done in parallel with work on the application code.
