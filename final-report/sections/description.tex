\subsection{Motivation}

Our access control system is designed to help employers look after the safety
of their employees.  This system provides employers with an access control
system that grants access to the workplace based on a security badge and
measured body temperature.  Additionally, our system helps building owners
adhere to social distancing guidelines implemented by the government by
tracking the number of people on the premises and restricting users from
entering the building when the maximum threshold for the building has been
attained.  Although not in the scope of the project, our system would work with
employers to comply with their standards and constraints to provide their
employees access to a COVID-19 free workplace.  Our system aims to enable a
COVID-19 free work environment.


\subsection{Design}

Our product is made up of two parts: the control server, and the door nodes.
Our product interacts with two types of actors: Operators and Users.


The control server maintains a database of door nodes, user profiles, and
interaction logs.  Operators can create and modify user profiles and system
settings (such as the maximum occupancy limit and the maximum allowable body
temperature).  When a user attempts to use a door node, their identity is
checked against their user profile.  Each interaction with a door node is
recorded in a user log.
