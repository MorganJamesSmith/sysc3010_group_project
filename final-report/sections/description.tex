\subsection{Motivation}

Our access control system is designed to help employers look after the safety
of their employees. The scope of this project is to provide employers with an
access control system that grants access to the workplace based on their
measured body temperature. As studies show that fever is the most frequent
symptom in more than 50\% of COVID-19 cases, our system also blocks access to
users that had previously scored a body temperature indicating a fever in the
past 14 days. Additionally, our system helps building owners adhere to social
distancing guidelines implemented by the government by tracking the number of
people on the premises and restricting users from entering the building when
the maximum threshold for the building has been attained. Although not in the
scope of the project, our system would work with employers to comply with their
standards and constraints to provide their employees access to a COVID-19 free
workplace. Our system aims to enable a COVID-19 free work environment.


Our product it made up of two parts: the control server, and the door nodes.
Our product interacts with two types of actors: Operators and Users.


The control server maintains a database of operator profiles, operator logs,
user profiles, and interaction logs.  The control server will use the operator
profiles to validate users using the operator GUI.  Every action performed in
the operator GUI will be logged in the operator logs.  Operators can create and
modify user profiles.  When a user attempts to use a door node, their identity
is checked against their user profile.  Each interaction with a door node is
recorded in a user log.
